                            To start the refund process, please send us an email at LegendConquer@gmail.com with the order ID you wish to refund.
                            If your case doesn't meet these requirements, you aren't able to ask for a refund and disputing any refund case would cause a permanent ban to your account.
                            ConquerWeb staff will review your request and will generally notify you via email of the results within 3-4 business days.
